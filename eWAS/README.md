#  Testing for association between exploratory behavior and gene expression


## Required R / Bioconductor packages

* [topGO](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/topGO.html)

* [caper](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caper/index.html) 


## Gene expression data  

These come from: \
Taher, A. E. et al. (2021) Gene expression dynamics during rapid organismal diversification in African cichlid fishes. Nat Ecol Evol 5, 243â€“250. doi: 10.1038/s41559-020-01354-3


## Goals 

* Preprocessing the gene expression data

* Association of gene expression with exploratory behavior

* Gene Ontology analysis of genes whose expression in the adult brain is associated with exploratory behavior

* Comparing association of behavior to gene expression with association of behavior to genotypes (Fig. 2B)
 
## Usage

All the analyses are documented in R script `expression_eWAS.R`.
